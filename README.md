# Hidden Calculator Words 
<br>
## Sloth Bytes Daily Challenge (11th March 2025) 
<br>
### This program takes a number as an input and flips the number 180 degrees (as if flipped on a calculator) to show a word! 
<br>
### The function takes in a number (a string) from the user, and checks if each digit in the number is in the pre-defined dictionary (which has the numbers and corresponding letters as key-value pairs), then that letter corresponding to the digit is appending to an empty string. The string is then reversed, mimicking the 180 degree turn on a calculator.
